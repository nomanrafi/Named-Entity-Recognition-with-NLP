# Named-Entity-Recognition-with-NLP
This repository implements Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. NER is a crucial NLP task that identifies and categorizes entities in text, such as names of people, locations, organizations, dates, and more. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to detect and label named entities in text.

## Features:<br>
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare datasets for training, including tokenization and annotation.
- Model Training with SpaCy/Transformers: Train NER models using popular NLP libraries like SpaCy or Hugging Faceâ€™s Transformers.
- Entity Categories: Recognize entities such as PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DATE, MONEY, etc.
- Evaluation Metrics: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
- Pre-trained Models: Option to use pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for improved accuracy.

## Key Topics Covered:<br>
- Tokenization and text preprocessing
- NER model training with supervised learning
- Leveraging pre-trained transformer models
- Model fine-tuning and evaluation for accurate entity detection

## Getting Started:<br>
- Clone this repository to explore the code.
- Install the required libraries specified in requirements.txt.
- Run the notebooks to train models and test NER on sample text data.


## Applications:<br>
NER is widely used in fields such as information retrieval, question answering, content analysis, and data mining, making it essential for extracting valuable information from text.
